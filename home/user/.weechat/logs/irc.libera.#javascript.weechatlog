2021-11-24 14:45:06	seabass	Hello! One thing I've noticed with typical React projects with NPM is that there are static files in the public/ directory
2021-11-24 14:46:07	seabass	when you build your Javascript code, it's usually minified and then goes into public/
2021-11-24 14:46:37	seabass	this seems a little messy to me, as you have a mixture of version controlled, static files and not-version-controlled generated files in one directory.
2021-11-24 14:47:02	seabass	does anyone here have any examples of projects where this is not the case, and the public directory is always created anew from other files? Thanks!

2021-11-24 15:01:34	seabass	powftw: so it seems as if you need to count from the beginning to find which line that index is on
2021-11-24 15:02:28	powftw	start of a line, yes
2021-11-24 15:03:09	powftw	if i have the line number, can i make it to start counting index from there in this code https://plnkr.co/edit/6ZHFYJ3qrTxPY0h0 ?
2021-11-24 15:03:34	seabass	sure, but you need to get the start index of each line first

2021-11-24 15:50:00	han-solo	it doesn't necessarily have to be formData i think, you could just json stringify the object you have
