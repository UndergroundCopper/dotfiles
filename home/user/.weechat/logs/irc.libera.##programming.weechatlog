2021-11-24 15:28:01	marduk	Velkorq: I worked as a "web developer" a couple of jobs back. There's about 3 different groups. One group does all the mockups/design.. they probably don't consider themselve web designers though. Then there's a "front-end" group who mostly work with node, react, stuff like that. They build "components" and then there's the group that I worked in
2021-11-24 15:28:01	marduk	that mostly worked on backend stuff, some front and (using the afore-mentioned components). I think all but the first I would consider programmers but even the first group didn't consider themselves programmers.
2021-11-24 15:28:02	Velkorq	i mean pure javascript isn't used that much. they use things like angular and react as frameworks
2021-11-24 15:28:15	Velkorq	is this considered programming? its not in the usual sense

2021-11-24 15:30:41	pyzozord	for me programmer needs to write code, understand what a variable and a loop is and write lots of them

2021-11-24 15:31:44	marduk	I mean the labels didn't matter. But all three groups were necessary. Coz I don't like doing the component stuff. The component people aren't necessarily good at design and the design people aren't necessarily good at coding.

2021-11-24 15:32:19	Velkorq	marduk: aren't those groups referred to as developers nowadays?
2021-11-24 15:33:00	ThePhilgrim	Watching a tutorial on sending data to server with fetch(). The guys says one can use either formData object, or by content type url encoded string. Any pros and cons I should consider between these two options?
2021-11-24 15:33:29	marduk	Velkorq: I think if you asked the design people they would not say they are developers. Because they spend 90% of their time using wireframing apps. I'm sure all/most of them know a bit of JavaScript/HTML but they don't spend the majority of their time coding.  We never called them developers. We called them "the design team"
2021-11-24 15:33:30	pyzozord	Velkorq: I think the latest term is "engineers"

2021-11-24 16:39:04	corn266	wait how are you using the term static
2021-11-24 16:39:29	Bombe	The way the JLS uses it.

2021-11-24 16:40:11	[itchyjunk]	but yeah, not using non existant .get will solve this issue
2021-11-24 16:40:18	corn266	cause if i instantiate a variable by: Type[] var_name = new Type[<some_int>]; then i have var_name which represents an array of some length and type

2021-11-24 16:40:57	corn266	i can't change the length, so it's static
