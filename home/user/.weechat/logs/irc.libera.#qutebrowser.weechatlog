2021-11-24 11:22:45	Velkorq	Will there be implemented a way to block youtube video ads?
2021-11-24 11:22:52	Velkorq	the builtin adblocker allows them
2021-11-24 11:24:38	The-Compiler	Velkorq: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/6480
2021-11-24 11:29:12	Velkorq	The-Compiler: oh, can we use braves adblocker in the future then?
2021-11-24 11:29:15	Velkorq	that would be nice
2021-11-24 11:29:44	The-Compiler	Velkorq: you can already use brave's adblocker now, but only with network blocking

2021-11-24 11:47:15	Velkorq	The-Compiler: didn't know that. well i don't want to block all my network using that. don't trust it much
2021-11-24 11:47:26	Velkorq	wanted something browser only maybe
2021-11-24 11:47:43	Velkorq	also are chrome addons a possibility? since we use webengine
2021-11-24 11:50:11	The-Compiler	Velkorq: I don't follow. Support for the brave adblocking library is integrated in qutebrowser v2.0.0.
2021-11-24 11:50:28	The-Compiler	(i.e. since almost a year ago)
2021-11-24 11:50:47	Velkorq	The-Compiler: emh. i just used the builtin :adblock-update
2021-11-24 11:50:55	Velkorq	i have to read on how to enable that
2021-11-24 11:51:35	The-Compiler	Velkorq: as for WebExtensions, see the FAQ in https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/30
2021-11-24 11:51:53	The-Compiler	Velkorq: do you see the 'adblock' library in :version?
2021-11-24 11:54:35	Velkorq	https://paste.the-compiler.org/view/53c3263d
2021-11-24 11:54:38	Velkorq	not sure which one it is
2021-11-24 11:55:20	The-Compiler	Velkorq: "qutebrowser v1.10.1"
2021-11-24 11:56:03	Velkorq	oh i just have an ancient version ok
2021-11-24 11:56:06	The-Compiler	yes
2021-11-24 11:56:18	Velkorq	i am just using the latest lts of ubuntu 20.04 
2021-11-24 11:56:30	Velkorq	not sure why the use such old version of qutebrowser
2021-11-24 11:56:48	The-Compiler	well yes, that's how an LTS works, you get ancient versions of everything
2021-11-24 11:57:02	Velkorq	anyway, great browser. i like it a lot!
2021-11-24 11:58:20	The-Compiler	Velkorq: see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/install.asciidoc#installing-qutebrowser-with-virtualenv for an easy way to get a newer version
2021-11-24 12:04:19	Velkorq	thanks
