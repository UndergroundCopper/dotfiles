2021-11-22 17:00:17	Velkorq	is ubuntu lts any more recent (in packages) than debian stable?
2021-11-22 17:00:31	Velkorq	or it tracks debian stable releases exactly?

With xorg, I can log in, but I get a fullscreen "A problem has occurred and the system can't recover. Please log out and try again". If I click, I get booted out. Right now, I've kept it up because the desktop actually works.. How can I see what's up and get this annoying popup to never appear again ?

2021-11-24 14:51:45	pseudonymous	idnc_sk: I think JS exemplifies the issue. Software has 1000 dependencies, all ever-changing. CPU and RAM is assumed free - so more is required to do the same as before (think Pidgin vs electron chat apps). And honestly, the desktop seems to crash a lot more than it did in the KDE3/Gnome 2 days. /rant

2021-11-25 13:11:16	XATRIX	Hi, can you advice ? Is there any option to make my wifi be enabled after login ? After i updated from 18.04 to 20.04.3, after i do login, my laptop is in offline state. I click network manager in tray, and set the checkbox "wifi enabled", later on i have connected

2021-11-25 13:16:22	EriC^^	XATRIX: i think you can use rfkill to enable it
2021-11-25 13:16:25	TJ-	XATRIX: this info may help. NetworkManager's enable/disable Wifi actually resets/sets the rfkill soft block, if I recall correctly. There is also a separate system service to that saves/restores the state of the rfkill block. I'm wondering if somethin in the upgrade means your system's rfkill service is blocking wifi on each reboot

2021-11-25 13:21:09	TJ-	XATRIX: it does; so possibly something else. Next, I'd check NetworkManager's log for rfkill related messages. " journalctl -b -u NetworkManager  | grep rfkill "

2021-11-25 13:40:15	XATRIX	So, i should do some .sh script , and put in after the system start , to do some rfkill enable ?

2021-11-25 13:42:24	TJ-	XATRIX: if it turns out the module is included in the initialramfs you'd need to do "update-initramfs -u" to have that setting copied into the initrd.img
2021-11-25 13:43:00	TJ-	XATRIX: the downside here is you may lose access to the special key functions and other firmware-specific functionality
2021-11-25 13:43:40	TJ-	XATRIX: but, if this works I'd recommend contacting the maintainers of the ideapad-latop module with details of your device so they can add a workaround to fix this, or recommend how else to deal with it
2021-11-25 13:43:52	XATRIX	I have Lenovo G50-70, so, it's a bit dated laptop. I don't think it has some cool, functionality :)

2021-11-25 13:48:50	TJ-	XATRIX: but that is VERY old so the model matching must be different - I'll try to find out what commit that patch is, so we can see if there's a simple patch can be done for your model too
