2021-11-24 13:34:10	grawity	yeah; some older systems from 8+ years ago *did* have UEFI but it was very dependent on luck
2021-11-24 13:34:14	Gagis	on computers that did not come with a CRT monitor, the answer is usually UEFI

2021-11-24 13:37:03	grawity	anyway, I'd create a 1-2 GB swap partition, but not more than that
2021-11-24 13:37:07	luigibu	is just to test the instalation.. if i success.. i will install it over another 1T drive
2021-11-24 13:37:28	Gagis	I think I have half of my total ram as swap but that feels way more than necessary with modern computers with tons of ram. 1-2 GB sounds a lot more sane than this

2021-11-24 13:38:04	luigibu	sweet! thanks! I problably.. will have more question.. hope you dont mind..
2021-11-24 13:38:16	greenhamster	I don't have swap at all with 64GB of RAM. If I ever run out of RAM I'll look into swap files.

2021-11-24 15:40:02	Arsimael	Hi.
2021-11-24 15:41:25	Arsimael	I just have a quick question: I am reinstalling arch and editing the mkinitcpio.conf file. I usually enter "ext4" under the Modules=() line, and I am still wondering why? Isn'T ext4 directly supported by the kernel? what if I want to use a different FS like xfs?
2021-11-24 15:41:54	jkc	Never needed to add that to modules, ever. ext4, xfs work out of the box.
2021-11-24 15:42:15	jkc	Someone else here may be able to give examples of when that's needed, but I've never had to.
2021-11-24 15:42:54	Arsimael	Thats what I am assuming. It's just some install tutorials (which i still use as a little help not to forget a step) still suggest it.
2021-11-24 15:43:07	jkc	And that's why random tutorials suck.
2021-11-24 15:43:19	rcf	Arsimael: mkinitcpio is smart enough to figure out your root filesystem type and include the appropriate modules automatically.
2021-11-24 15:43:19	Arsimael	arch tutorials
2021-11-24 15:43:20	Namarrgon	the 'filesystem' hook already adds the right modules
2021-11-24 15:43:20	jkc	And rather than using some shitty tutorial, use the wiki. :)
2021-11-24 15:43:37	Arsimael	that is from the Wiki
2021-11-24 15:43:40	rcf	Arsimael: though keep in mind that no filesystem types are supported by the kernel alone, they're all modules.

2021-11-25 12:45:08	roxlu	Hi, maybe this is not right place to ask (I'm not entirely sure). I'm reading up on condition variables a bit and especially the case where you use one of the two cases to signal a thread: 1) lock/signal(cv)/unlock OR just 2) signal(cv). Where `cv` is a condition variable. I read that when a signaled thread wakes up it must block on the mutex. Is that right?

2021-11-25 13:14:22	grawity	it would be the bottleneck if you put an SSD in there (as 3 Gbps is only 300 MB/s, and that's the raw link speed – I think actual data would be somewhere 250 MB/s)
2021-11-25 13:14:27	Velkorq	i can just use external usb 3.0
2021-11-25 13:14:41	twistero	on the other hand, for a permanent install, you could always install GRUB on the internal drive, and it will boot from anywhere

2021-11-25 14:20:24	Velkorq	anyway will get the 9.5mm and force it. thanks!
2021-11-25 14:21:29	Velkorq	by the way is there a way to boot in uefi mode, a gpt partition table, but without have to use that annoying fat32 partition?
2021-11-25 14:21:37	jkc	No.
2021-11-25 14:21:55	jkc	UEFI boot means EFI System Partition. ESP means FAT32.
2021-11-25 14:21:57	Velkorq	is it a grub limitation or a specification limitation?
2021-11-25 14:22:04	jkc	UEFI spec requires it.
2021-11-25 14:22:26	Velkorq	thats one reason i want to go back to legacy
2021-11-25 14:22:41	jkc	Because you have to create a partition?
2021-11-25 14:22:45	demize	That's not entirely true.  The spec requires FAT32 to be supported, but doesn't require that it be the only supported thing.  Most firmware doesn't support anything else though.
2021-11-25 14:22:56	Velkorq	does fat32 even have journaling?
2021-11-25 14:23:03	Repentinus	No.
2021-11-25 14:23:19	Repentinus	But you are not supposed to be constantly changing stuff on your UEFI partition.
2021-11-25 14:23:24	Gagis	well its a partition containing like five files so I suppose it doesnt matter much

2021-11-25 14:23:57	grawity	if you put your kernel on the ESP – well, the way mkinitcpio updates your initramfs, having journalling would not save you
2021-11-25 14:24:02	Velkorq	i had it become corrupted once, and had to reinstall the mbr or whatever
2021-11-25 14:24:05	Velkorq	with grub
2021-11-25 14:24:35	grawity	if you only put GRUB on the ESP – journalling doesn't matter most of the time, only when you grub-install the 1 file
2021-11-25 14:24:53	grawity	which
2021-11-25 14:25:07	Velkorq	the fat32 partition just mounts at /boot/boot
2021-11-25 14:25:07	grawity	is exactly the same as when you're updating GRUB on BIOS systems, by the way
2021-11-25 14:25:09	Velkorq	or /boot/esp

2021-11-25 14:26:12	grawity	since the BIOS Boot Partition (you need a BIOS Boot Partition to use GRUB on GPT, by the way) lacks a filesystem that'd support journalling

2021-11-25 14:27:01	jkc	But the correct answer is that UEFI expects FAT.
2021-11-25 14:27:11	jkc	Because the spec, as written, explicitly states that.

I have my system language set to en_US and I have spellcheck turned on in hexchat and spellcheck language set to en_US, is there anything I'm missing?
2021-11-29 16:49:13	earnest	demize: What takes hours for you?  Before this build station it was freecad for me
2021-11-29 16:49:16	demize	But for packages, the decompression time difference on install does make a difference on my experience.

2021-11-29 16:49:35	earnest	I hope zig wins, somehow

2021-11-29 16:49:49	demize	I doubt anything we have now will win in the long run.
2021-11-29 16:50:00	rcf	There is no winning in software
2021-11-29 16:50:22	demize	But I do hope that whatever does end up winning in similar ways to what C has had will end up taking a lot of inspiration from the simplicity of zig.

2021-11-29 16:51:47	demize	I do like how so much of what makes Zig neat comes out of taking the mental model of C and making it simpler.
2021-11-29 16:52:05	earnest	demize: (I like stuff which precomputes as much as it can, so zig's approach is nice here.  I still think Ada is nice but haven't followed that for year now)
