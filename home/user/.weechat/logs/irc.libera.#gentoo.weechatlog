2021-11-24 11:15:27	projectmoon	it tells me "not a dynamic executable"
2021-11-24 11:15:44	+leio	projectmoon: The multilib deps of steam itself should be there in a steam ebuild, and from there everything else would theoretically come from the steam runtime. If you opt to not use the steam runtime (an option in the steam-overlay steam ebuild iirc), then host ones are needed and there's a tool called "esteam" (a package in steam-overlay as well) which will scan your installed games and generate a set for you with the necessary multilib (and native)
2021-11-24 11:15:44	+leio	dependencies for your installed games to work; at least it did years ago when I used it

2021-11-24 11:16:11	+leio	alternatively one could use steam from flatpak and have it tucked away in a sandbox as a proprietary thing
2021-11-24 11:16:12	projectmoon	leio: that might be what i need yes. i have steamruntime use flag enabled at the moment
2021-11-24 11:16:19	projectmoon	it's generally recommended to use the runtime anyway right
2021-11-24 11:16:54	projectmoon	but yes i see use flag setup
2021-11-24 11:16:58	projectmoon	maybe i will try that just for the lolz
2021-11-24 11:17:16	projectmoon	i ran into a problem with native version of shadows of the tomb raider, but that happens even with the steam runtime

2021-11-24 11:17:50	+leio	years ago I had to use it just to get away from the incompatibilities of what's bundled in the steam runtime and what isn't (runtime issues between what it ended up using from host vs the older versions of others things used via the runtime); I think it has gotten better though
2021-11-24 11:18:05	+leio	use it = disable steam runtime

2021-11-24 11:19:02	+leio	for me (and this was like 3-5 years ago) it was something about udev back then

2021-11-24 11:19:27	+leio	if I fresh installed steam now, I'd probably just install it from flatpak

2021-11-24 11:22:59	projectmoon	hmm after setting -steamruntime, it prompts to rebuild steam-meta and steam-games-meta, but doesn't prompt to update a bunch of other libs to 32bit, which it should be

2021-11-24 11:26:22	genr8eofl_	uhh
2021-11-24 11:26:40	genr8eofl_	making your entire system 32 bit is not advised
2021-11-24 11:26:41	pinkflames[m]	the mix and match approach relies on every maintainer in the chain of dependencies having bothered to get their multilib deps right and then kept them that way
2021-11-24 11:26:53	pinkflames[m]	genr8eofl_: it very much should be

2021-11-24 11:29:03	pinkflames[m]	because src_compile itself is often not the slowest part of emerge and many ebuilds will actually disable components for non-native build, so it sometimes only adds seconds to build time

2021-11-24 11:33:08	projectmoon	it's prompting now
2021-11-24 11:33:18	projectmoon	i had to set -steamruntime on a few other packages than steam-meta and steam-games-meta

2021-11-24 12:35:06	pinkflames[m]	Thanks for being the expert here - I have only replaced rules and did not know that the db needs a recompile ;)
2021-11-24 12:35:58	genr8eofl_	Guest23, echo "app-emulation/virtualbox java" > /etc/portage/package.use/virtualbox
2021-11-24 12:36:00	grawity	hwdb and rules can be updated on the fly without problems (`systemd-hwdb update` for the former and `udevadm control --reload` for the latter), but re-applying them to an existing device is more troublesome – if you can physically unplug and reconnect a USB keyboard that should do the job, but often it's easier to just reboot than mess around with `udevadm trigger` etc
2021-11-24 12:37:34	pinkflames[m]	grawity: what I meant is that there's a known bug in current WirePlumber 0.4.5 where doing udevadm trigger will break audio if it's been called once before
2021-11-24 12:38:07	grawity	ah yeah trigger can break stuff a lot

2021-11-24 12:38:18	pinkflames[m]	Hopefully the fix will land as WIrePlumber 0.4.5-r1 today (or within a few days) but there may be other such software
2021-11-24 12:38:37	grawity	might be a good idea to check with `udevadm info /sys/class/input/whatever` to make sure the hwdb additions are there

2021-11-24 13:04:10	pinkflames[m]	the output in isolation is a bit meaningless, IMO
2021-11-24 13:04:29	pinkflames[m]	it's far better to compare to a known working setup to find and eliminate differences from bottom to top

2021-11-24 13:06:28	pinkflames[m]	then how could you compare the libinput debug-events then?
2021-11-24 13:07:08	grawity	hmm systemd-localed just generates an Xorg.conf that sets the xkb keymap, right?

I believe the setting is the same for 8, 10 and 11. It's a single registry key. I used to set it up like that when I was dual-booting and this saved me a whole lot of trouble.

2021-11-24 16:55:01	l403	I've noticed google-chrome (bin) has +50% performance compared to chromium (built) on the Motionmark (1.2) benchmark. I wonder what the reason might be.

2021-11-24 17:22:27	marduk	It's probably because it's a binary driver and the binary has 32 and 64bit code so it has to depend on both(?)

2021-11-25 13:40:15	futurefutura	Hello !  In order to install gentoo on a new device, I make a logical volume, and inside it a partition table for boot and root. Question: how to mkfs.ext4 a partition inside a logical volume ?
2021-11-25 13:40:46	grawity	1) mkfs doesn't create partitions, and 2) you're not supposed to be creating partitions inside a logical volume because that's what *logical volumes* are for
2021-11-25 13:41:16	Mo	freakynl: Any difference doing the iperf as user or as root?
2021-11-25 13:41:17	grawity	assuming you meant LVM kind of logical volumes
2021-11-25 13:41:18	futurefutura	grawity i did the partition table nicely with fdisk. thats not my problem
2021-11-25 13:41:23	grawity	though a LVM logical volume for /boot doesn't sound very useful
2021-11-25 13:41:48	pinkflames[m]	I would just use GPT and maybe Btrfs subvolumes if that kind of functionality is required
2021-11-25 13:42:11	futurefutura	grawity yes, lvcreate blablabla 64G volumegroup, yes
2021-11-25 13:42:13	grawity	futurefutura: it is your problem, even if fdisk didn't complain while doing so
2021-11-25 13:42:39	grawity	the kernel won't recognize partition tables inside LVs (or other mapper devices)
2021-11-25 13:42:58	tirnanog	for real. nobody in their right mind tries to create partitoin tables inside logical volumes unless they are backing a VM or something.
2021-11-25 13:43:14	grawity	though partitions inside LVs are useless (and a /boot partition inside a LV is doubly useless)
2021-11-25 13:43:25	scardracs	pinkflames[m]: asking here as it isn't kde related
2021-11-25 13:43:28	grawity	I mean, again, that's literally what LVs themselves are supposed to be for
2021-11-25 13:43:45	tirnanog	they're useful for, say, qemu, but the issue of partitioning would then typically be punted to the guest itself.
2021-11-25 13:43:48	futurefutura	grawity i completed doing my partioning with fdisk . now I like to mkfs.ext4 /dev/volumegroup/mylogicalvolume_partition1/2
2021-11-25 13:43:59	scardracs	I was looking on how system greps for keyboard and found that
2021-11-25 13:44:03	grawity	futurefutura: and what stops you from mkfs.ext4 that?
2021-11-25 13:44:19	freakynl	tirnanog: Imho nobody in their right mind would use LVM in a VM to begin with, unless they need mirroring or something in the OS level. You can just use 1 virtual disk per partition you want. Chaining spread blocks together with LVM isn't necessary there

2021-11-25 13:45:13	tirnanog	freakynl: hmm? LVM is fantastically useful for acting as a pool of storage for block devices. I wasn't suggesting that anyone ought to create individual LVs for every block evice that might otherwise be a partition to a guest.
2021-11-25 13:45:15	futurefutura	grawity. when you look at disk images, you will agree once you dd them to a lv, you can offsetmount them and use them from inside. so there should be a way to encode a partition with mkfs and so
2021-11-25 13:45:21	scardracs	I've looked into dmidecode to see if it contains something useful but ends on that
2021-11-25 13:45:24	scardracs	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/DvI969pH/
2021-11-25 13:45:45	tirnanog	freakynl: i.e. /dev/kvmstore/<guestname>, which may technically contain partition metadata, but where the host shouldn't care, only the guest.
2021-11-25 13:45:50	grawity	futurefutura: there is, but that's extremely not the job of mkfs
2021-11-25 13:45:50	futurefutura	yea, dmidecode .... i was looking at that, too
2021-11-25 13:45:56	freakynl	tirnanog: Yea, it's fantastic for that. Which is awesome if you're limited with disks or raid at a physical level. These days that's seldom true, especially virtual
2021-11-25 13:46:34	grawity	futurefutura: there's a tool called "kpartx" (in, I think, multipath-tools) which sets up linear DM mappings for partitions on top of any block device, even those that the kernel wouldn't scan for partitions

2021-11-25 13:48:08	futurefutura	so there should be a way to create partitions inside a lv, too
2021-11-25 13:48:34	grawity	you already created them, doesn't mean the kernel knows how to access them
2021-11-25 13:48:35	tirnanog	freakynl: I'm really not sure what else it is that you're proposing. I have no intention of using filesystem-backed images. partitons would be ridiculously inflexible. if you're some huge operator that can back each guest with distinct physical storage then good for you. I would say that's far from being the case for everyone.
2021-11-25 13:49:10	grawity	futurefutura: again, if you really really want to do this, then run `kpartx` on your LV to detect the partitions – both for mkfs'ing, and for mounting

2021-11-29 12:42:41	Velkorq	and will we have eventually a minimal cd, that includes x11, with something like openbox, or jwm or whatever. (helps reading the handbook when installing)

2021-11-29 12:44:06	+kurly	Velkorq: you can use almost any linux environment you want to install gentoo; there's no need to use a gentoo branded one
2021-11-29 12:44:08	tirnanog	not sure if that covers everything, though.
2021-11-29 12:44:28	tirnanog	there are USE flag differences also. for example, if you need to set up LVM thin provisioning, minimal doesn't work.
2021-11-29 12:45:48	Velkorq	kurly: i remember the handbook, has some differences on mount points etc, because some distros use other mount points, or symlinks etc
2021-11-29 12:45:59	Velkorq	 thats why i always prefered using the gentoo one, to have less of a headache
2021-11-29 12:46:20	tirnanog	at any rate, I can tell you that the admincd doesn't contain X11 or anything of that sort.

2021-11-29 12:52:03	Velkorq	is the creation of the iso automated? can i write a build for a livecd iso that includes x11?
2021-11-29 12:52:26	tirnanog	after all, there used to be a livedvd. but it was infrequently refreshed and, as a result, I can't see that it had much use. someone has to put in the work to keep it fresh, ultimately.

2021-11-29 16:35:21	marduk	If there is a workaround it's likely to be in the bug report itself.  Also masking is a thing.

2021-12-02 13:54:06	+ionen	filling a bug explaining the issue would make more sense I think
