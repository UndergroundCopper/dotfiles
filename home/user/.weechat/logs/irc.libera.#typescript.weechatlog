2021-11-24 11:41:45	interop_madness	Are circular type dependencies such as this ok, or is there something I must be careful about? https://paste.ee/p/0PysM
2021-11-24 11:45:25	biberu	interop_madness: why does your base class need to know of derived classes?
2021-11-24 11:48:45	interop_madness	biberu, ultimately the base class will have a factory method for derived classes, this is just a nutshell exampel
2021-11-24 11:48:47	interop_madness	le

2021-11-24 11:50:22	biberu	if you could use e.g. a regular function instead the circular dependency would be broken, and it'd smell much better
2021-11-24 11:50:50	biberu	i.e. just remove create from Foo and put that in a free function
2021-11-24 11:51:02	interop_madness	ok, I'm taking that into consideration, but if I weren't doing it, could there be a problem I should be aware of?
2021-11-24 11:54:03	biberu	i'd just avoid circular references ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2021-11-24 12:01:24	interop_madness	biberu, ok, but is there a reason that goes beyond aesthetics/maintainability?

2021-11-24 12:06:11	biberu	interop_madness: do you know that all your tooling can handle circular references?
2021-11-24 12:07:09	interop_madness	no, I don't know that. webpack is involved
2021-11-24 12:08:06	biberu	maybe start there then
