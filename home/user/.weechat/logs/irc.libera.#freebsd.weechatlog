2021-11-25 11:41:11	tao	yes. the installer lets you select live. however it's only command line. it won't boot up into a graphical environment
2021-11-25 11:42:40	LXGHTNXNG	that's how the system installs by default. It's reasonably friendly if you have even minimal command of Unix, though there's some oddities if you're used to the GNU operating system.

2021-11-25 11:52:35	tao	it might be possible, but i think it would be very difficult. you would probably have to install it properly and then install the other stuff

2021-11-29 16:09:11	Velkorq	is the freshports site officially supported?
2021-11-29 16:09:24	Velkorq	and are those extra ports? or the same included in the freebsd system?
2021-11-29 16:09:34	Velkorq	(by extra i mean like the AUR of archlinux)

2021-11-29 16:10:54	Velkorq	dvl: so i am not meant to get ports scripts from there
2021-11-29 16:11:09	dvl	Velkorq: Correct.
2021-11-29 16:11:10	Velkorq	it is like package search to see what is available
2021-11-29 16:11:28	dvl	Velkorq: Yes, that's one use for the website
2021-11-29 16:11:55	Velkorq	by the way, is it advisable to use freebsd as a desktop system? i am currently using linux (haven't touched windows in decades)
2021-11-29 16:12:12	dvl	Velkorq: Sure, if you want to. I did for several years.
