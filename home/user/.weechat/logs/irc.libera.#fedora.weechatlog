2021-11-24 12:32:48	AquaL1te	Velkorq: there is a gnome and recently a KDE distribution of silverblue. you basically get an image with all the software. any other software requires a custom layer. so installing a different DE is not recommended, it will make updates slow. with silverblue you should use the base image, only add any system packages if there isn't another way. other ways are the toolbox container and flatpak

2021-11-24 12:35:47	Velkorq	AquaL1te: i wanted to use budgie desktop. How can it make upgrades slow. from what i understand is like overlayfs used in some liveusb's but using a frugal install on disk.
2021-11-24 12:36:09	Velkorq	the rootfs image will upgrade as usual, and my desktopfs image on top of it
2021-11-24 12:36:12	Velkorq	is that an issue?

2021-11-24 12:37:53	Velkorq	also regarding the toolbox container. does this thing need an OS installed in the container? like installing ubuntu inside of it. or can i just install my application only inside the container?
2021-11-24 12:42:55	Velkorq	AquaL1te: and another question. Can't i just use fedora coreos which is more minimal and just overlay only the desktop i want?
