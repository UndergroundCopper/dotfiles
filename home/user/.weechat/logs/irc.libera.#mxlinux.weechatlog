2021-11-24 13:49:22	Velkorq	hey
2021-11-24 13:49:31	Velkorq	how many years of support does mxlinux have?
2021-11-24 13:49:47	Velkorq	also are packages newer than debian stable? aka does it use testing repos as well from debian?
2021-11-24 15:21:48	nR	[IRC-nERDs] <~sorcerer> you can probably turn on the testing repo's, but testing doesnt come on
2021-11-24 15:21:53	nR	[IRC-nERDs] <~sorcerer> stable comes on by default
