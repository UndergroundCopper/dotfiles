There is a right way to do it, but chances are no one figures it out the first time.

2021-11-24 16:54:50	FreeBDSM	hello, I have some questions regarding some basic dirs with binaries. `ls -lash /bin/Mail` tells me it's a symlink pointing to `../../bin/mailx`. Afaiu, this should be broken path, since `../` relative to `/bin/` is `/` and thus `../../` should be something "above" root dir, which is an error (IMO), but `realpath /bin/Mail` returns `/usr/bin/mailx`, which is even weirder, because I could understand if `/../../../../` would be equal to just `/`, since
2021-11-24 16:54:51	FreeBDSM	that's the topmost level in fs tree already, and then the path should be /bin/mailx, which is not a symlink. Why is it so?

2021-11-25 12:43:35	soxfoxrox1	PaulFertser, I would assume that normally a script after running would no longer have a PID (but may not be right). What I see is the same script having a lot of PID's as though it were still running(?)

2021-11-25 13:37:21	HiccupJul	i've got a php (html) file and a cgi (perl) script. is there a simple http server i can use to run this for local usage? python3 -m http.server doesn't seem to support php/cgi, and installing apache seems to start a public http server by default. should i just try and find a way to configure apache before installation (or install with internet disconnected?). or should i try and find something simpler than apache?

2021-11-29 12:55:04	jim	so why even give freenode a second thought? whether they're alive or dead, we're alive, and not under korean control
2021-11-29 12:55:29	binaryhermit	has it been that long Sauvin
2021-11-29 12:56:00	binaryhermit	it doesn't seem that long, but on the other hand, COVID's messed up all normal sense of time flow
2021-11-29 12:56:04	Sauvin	Korea doesn't care one way or another. Forget Lee's nationality or ethnicity or whatever, we're live and not under the control of a delusional crackheaded megalomaniacal idiot.
2021-11-29 12:56:29	binaryhermit	it has more to do with him thinking he's the emperor of korea, which isn't a thing

2021-11-29 15:20:51	hexnewbie	pagios: In theory, the way you've been doing it for the certificate signed by the CA. HOWEVER, in practice, unless you are making your own CA (I gather you are NOT, from what you've shared), one would first investigate why that third party CA is not trusted in the first place. I wouldn't trust a random third party my distro decided not to trust
