2021-11-22 17:43:13	cpaelzer	ginggs: I see you have ~10 days ago submitted a bunch of no-change-rebuilds for netcdf but this still has various problems
2021-11-22 17:43:48	cpaelzer	ginggs: like FTBFS of libpdl-netcdf-perl ferret-vis vtk6 - since you did the NCR did you look into those builds fails already?
