2021-11-22 15:25:51	msk`	glibc versions are different; so that's one thing that stands out
2021-11-22 15:26:17	msk`	Haohmaru yes some C++ code that depends on the mainline build.
2021-11-22 15:26:55	Haohmaru	just let it build and go drink a long coffee ;P~
2021-11-22 15:27:08	Haohmaru	or a long long coffee
2021-11-22 15:27:19	Haohmaru	long long double coffee
2021-11-22 15:27:36	msk`	:D hehe
2021-11-22 15:28:55	msk`	how do i solve this (Debian GLIBC 2.31-13+deb11u2) 2.31 ?
2021-11-22 15:29:12	msk`	can i get glibc to upgrade to 2.32
2021-11-22 15:29:38	Haohmaru	:/
2021-11-22 15:29:59	Haohmaru	maybe it could be just simpler to get debian-next for this one operation
2021-11-22 15:30:10	Haohmaru	,v glibc
2021-11-22 15:30:11	judd	No package named 'glibc' was found in amd64.
2021-11-22 15:30:28	msk`	yepp
2021-11-22 15:30:31	idioterna	that's going to be a very difficult thing to do, it's best to just update to bookworm if you need a gcc that recent
2021-11-22 15:31:13	idioterna	just about everything depends on glibc so
2021-11-22 15:31:16	msk`	idioterna yes
2021-11-22 15:31:42	idioterna	change sources lists to bookworm and do dist upgrade
2021-11-22 15:32:01	idioterna	but only if this is a testing machine where you can afford something like that
2021-11-22 15:32:30	msk`	unfortunately no.
2021-11-22 15:32:56	Haohmaru	if this is a short-term thing, then perhaps install debian-next in another partition or even just run it off of a USB stick

2021-11-22 15:34:02	msk`	Haohmaru let me think. all good ideas.
2021-11-22 15:34:44	idioterna	i'd recommend a docker image of the bookworm
2021-11-22 15:34:54	Khepra	msk`: make your life easier. debootstrap and chroot or systemd-nspawn; build and run your software in that namespace
2021-11-22 15:34:59	idioterna	if one already exists, you can experiment inside a docker shell
2021-11-22 15:35:18	idioterna	if it doesn't, you can do the dist upgrade inside a bullseye docker
2021-11-22 15:35:37	idioterna	or that
2021-11-22 15:35:52	idioterna	i haven't played with systemd-nspawn, i should
2021-11-22 15:36:06	Khepra	docker is not really the first (or at all) containerization tool I'd recommend. it's designed for single application use. people abuse it as a "VM" with shell and ssh access
2021-11-22 15:36:21	msk`	the C++ program manipulates the cgroups and namespaces. so running it inside a container, mmm.
2021-11-22 15:36:48	Khepra	this is literally as simple as:    `debootstrap bookworm /path/to/a/dir/where/you/wanna/put/it ; systemd-nspawn -D /that/path`
2021-11-22 15:36:55	msk`	Khepra in the general scenario what you write makes a lot of sense.
2021-11-22 15:37:06	Khepra	vary for actual functionality needed, like binding paths or devices, capabilities, etc...

2021-11-22 15:39:44	Khepra	msk`: namespaces can be nested; which is even more of a reason not to abuse docker; ultimately maybe run in a VM, and see if you can port/adapt it to run in your native environment

2021-11-22 16:52:48	Velkorq	how many years of support does debian lts offer?
2021-11-22 16:53:17	Haohmaru	!lts
2021-11-22 16:53:17	dpkg	Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years.  Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies.  Ask me about <jessie-lts> and <stretch-lts> and see https://wiki.debian.org/LTS for more information.  #debian-lts on irc.oftc.net.
2021-11-22 16:53:41	Velkorq	Haohmaru: HOW DO I ENABLE IT?
2021-11-22 16:53:45	Velkorq	sorry for caps
2021-11-22 16:53:47	-->	tizef (~tizef@202.153.80.9) has joined #debian
2021-11-22 16:53:59	Haohmaru	uhm, i don't think you.. enable.. it
2021-11-22 16:54:01	Velkorq	is it enabled by default or i have to enable another repo?
2021-11-22 16:54:17	Haohmaru	generally, you should use the stable release
2021-11-22 16:54:31	Velkorq	so the 5 years ubuntu offers for ubuntu LTS releases, are basically what debian offers. its not their own work
2021-11-22 16:54:56	Haohmaru	ubuntu has a company behind it pulling the strings
2021-11-22 16:55:28	Velkorq	yeah but since they use debian as base, the 5 years of support for lts comes from debian people
2021-11-22 16:55:40	Velkorq	its not a special thing of ubuntu specifically
2021-11-22 16:55:44	Haohmaru	no, i wouldn't think so
2021-11-22 16:56:18	Haohmaru	first of all, ubuntu takes packages from debian (but not from debian stable exactly), opens them up, sh*ts in them, then repackages them
2021-11-22 16:56:36	Haohmaru	roughly speaking ;P~
2021-11-22 16:56:39	Velkorq	basically i want to install either debian or ubuntu on a family member's laptop and i want something which has many years of support like 5

2021-11-22 16:56:51	Velkorq	and i was looking how many years debian and ubuntu offer for lts
2021-11-22 16:56:59	Haohmaru	so put debian stable, and just keep it updated
2021-11-22 16:57:27	Velkorq	the only good thing ubuntu offers for noobs, is do-release-upgrade. can take you from one lts to the next
2021-11-22 16:57:29	Haohmaru	right now debian11 came out recently, so when debian12 comes out - upgrade that machine to 12
2021-11-22 16:57:34	Velkorq	debian needs changing sources for that
2021-11-22 16:57:39	Velkorq	and following manuals
2021-11-22 16:57:43	Haohmaru	yeah
2021-11-22 16:58:41	Velkorq	Haohmaru: is it a good idea to use debian on laptop/desktop? wont packages be outdated, i thought it was suited more for a server
2021-11-22 16:58:54	Velkorq	or should i just get newer packages from flatpak or something
2021-11-22 16:59:58	Haohmaru	newer versions of mostly popular things often are available into debian stable from the so called "backports"
2021-11-22 17:00:59	Velkorq	Haohmaru: i do use backports, but its kind of hard to find which is available on backports from command line
2021-11-22 17:01:14	Velkorq	since i can't just enable backports repo in general
2021-11-22 17:01:16	Haohmaru	yeah, i use synaptic
2021-11-22 17:01:39	Haohmaru	eh, why can't you?
2021-11-22 17:02:09	Haohmaru	i mean, you add backports into sources.list
2021-11-22 17:02:16	Velkorq	i was advised not to enable backports globally, but just take specific packages. apt-get -t backports whatever
2021-11-22 17:02:23	Haohmaru	yeah
2021-11-22 17:02:49	Haohmaru	you can probably make the backports stuff have "priority" over the "normal" stuff, but i wouldn't
2021-11-22 17:02:52	Velkorq	also i need a gui package manager for beginners. synaptic or gnome-software?
2021-11-22 17:03:01	Velkorq	Haohmaru: yes thats what i mean

2021-11-24 11:27:23	Velkorq	debian needs to implement something like do-release-upgrade ubuntu has, to auto upgrade from one release to the next. noobs can't easily do the migration
2021-11-24 11:28:56	rk4	in such a scheme i imagine no one reads release notes, particularly the upgrading from previous version bits?
2021-11-24 11:30:27	Velkorq	i mean i use debian personally, but i am not a total beginner. if i install it on a noob's pc probably it will stay on that version past the 5 years of support debian offers
2021-11-24 11:30:45	Velkorq	ubuntu has this tool to migrate automatically and also sends gui notifications, can be run from gui
2021-11-24 11:31:04	somiaj	You can use 'stable' as the release name, and this will automatically upgrade
2021-11-24 11:31:17	Velkorq	somiaj: is this safe to do?
2021-11-24 11:31:22	jelly	somiaj, that's a bad idea, please don't suggest it
2021-11-24 11:31:25	somiaj	It isn't suggested and I have had ubuntu's auto upgrade feature break enough I don't trust it
2021-11-24 11:31:26	rk4	i do not advocate debian to 'noobs' personally
2021-11-24 11:31:51	Velkorq	rk4: what do you install for noobs?
2021-11-24 11:32:07	Velkorq	i used to install mxlinux, but it has annoying bugs
2021-11-24 11:32:17	rk4	tbh, since they don't give a shit about FLOSS, i suggest chromebooks
2021-11-24 11:32:45	Velkorq	i mean on a laptop that runs windows.
2021-11-24 11:32:59	rk4	at least then i can be semi confident their bank account can only be emptied by browser extensions, not random programs they installed
2021-11-24 11:33:00	Velkorq	somiaj: so auto upgrade can't be trusted?
2021-11-24 11:33:29	somiaj	I wouldn't trust it, one should upgrade at the time they choose.
2021-11-24 11:33:53	Velkorq	somiaj: it upgrades when you tell it to. just notifies you, unless they changed that. haven't used ubuntu in 10 years
2021-11-24 11:34:02	somiaj	I did try to install ubuntu on my parents machine, they liked it until one day it broke. It was the auto upgrade between releases that broke it
2021-11-24 11:34:04	rk4	if a 'noob' has a laptop running windows, i'm not sure if i'm doing them a favor replacing that with a *nix
2021-11-24 11:34:10	jelly	Velkorq, the thing with automatic upgrades is they do not exist because it's a hard problem, can genuinely be problematic and break things.  You can make it work if your users have a specific subset of packages and you iterate testing the upgrade procedure
2021-11-24 11:34:20	Velkorq	somiaj: maybe the interrupted it, or shutdown the pc.

2021-11-24 11:35:54	Velkorq	jelly: so its dafe as long as you stay within their repos, that they can test
2021-11-24 11:35:59	rk4	if i were interested in such things though, fedora silverblue looks promising, maybe it'll become [or is?] a good option for people who do zero maintainance and just don't care
2021-11-24 11:36:06	Velkorq	also i kind of hate snaps
2021-11-24 11:36:36	Velkorq	rk4: don't know that, i remember normal fedora, that was debian sid territory
2021-11-24 11:36:40	jelly	Velkorq, no, it's not safe even if you only use debian.org repos
2021-11-24 11:36:49	somiaj	Debian releases only happen every two years and oldstable is supported for a year. You could just help with the upgrade every 2 years or so.
2021-11-24 11:37:02	jelly	Velkorq, the safe thing is to read the release notes.
2021-11-24 11:37:23	rk4	silverblue is an immutable desktop, so similar to jelly's comment about if you have a known set of packages
2021-11-24 11:37:24	Velkorq	rk4: i will check out fedora you said about, and maybe opensuse leap, or something.
2021-11-24 11:37:27	somiaj	And upgrade at a time of the admin's choosing so they can be around to deal with any hiccups

2021-11-24 11:40:01	jelly	Microsoft has tens of thousands of engineers and they can't keep their OS from breaking on upgrades, either

2021-11-24 11:42:14	Velkorq	by the way does debian stable offer 2 or 5 years of support?
2021-11-24 11:42:26	Velkorq	somewhere i read 2, on debian lts i read 5
2021-11-24 11:42:31	Velkorq	i am confused
2021-11-24 11:42:55	somiaj	for desktop support 3 years (2 years stable + 1 year oldstable)
2021-11-24 11:43:02	somiaj	lts gives 2 more years for server side stuff
2021-11-24 11:43:17	Velkorq	so if i use it on desktop i get 3 years basically
2021-11-24 11:43:18	somiaj	though usually the browser support is dropped about 1/2 a year into old stable
2021-11-24 11:43:31	rk4	the problem with using debian for 20 years...is hey i thought we didn't have LTS, neat
2021-11-24 11:43:37	somiaj	I would go more about 2.5 due to browser support being dropped, or install your browser from another method.
2021-11-24 11:44:52	Velkorq	ubuntu lts is 5 years. mmm might install that so i can have my mind peaceful for 5 years. they will probably change laptop in 5 years, won't have to upgrade to next release once
2021-11-24 11:45:34	Khepra	browsers on ubuntu are snaps. you can snap them on debian too, if that's a concern.

2021-11-24 11:50:56	jelly	not much different from ubuntu, which promises security updates only for stuff in main
2021-11-24 11:51:16	Khepra	just like ubuntu LTS really. Or ubuntu anything if you consider that Universe is a community effort and not a Canonical obligation
2021-11-24 11:51:30	jelly	(and no clue how they expose security promises for snaps)
2021-11-24 11:51:38	Khepra	they don't at all
2021-11-24 11:51:58	Khepra	the whole point of snaps is that it's hands off for Canonical. Vendor's responsibility. whatever the vendor is doing. Canonical's is only for snapd itself.

2021-11-24 11:52:54	Khepra	jelly: shush, get out of my head and lemme finish my sentences ;)
2021-11-24 11:53:05	jelly	Velkorq, main is some 2-3k packages, not all desktop, not all server
2021-11-24 11:53:16	Velkorq	i see
2021-11-24 11:53:22	Khepra	the point here being that those snaps have the same security promises regardless of distro that has tehm installable on
2021-11-24 11:53:23	Velkorq	so mostly security stuff for 5 years

2021-11-24 11:55:59	Khepra	"linux desktop" is really a sucky experience that no corporation has in standard offering, with the exception of RedHat and "GNOME for WorkGroups". Canonical implied recently (few years back) they're effectively giving up on desktop and concentrating on server and the cloud. They did so by nuking their desktop specific products like mir and unity. And I think Shuttleworth even spelled it out literally, in

2021-11-25 11:42:44	ocb	jelly: https://termbin.com/4dng the install is with lxde completely fresh without a single file changed, except 'interfaces' after i noticed networking does not work. during the netinstall networking worked without issues. tried disabling avahi in the meantime and removed isc-dhcp-{common,client} just to make sure it isn't dhcp doing its thing for whatever reason.
2021-11-25 11:44:16	ocb	once i do 'service networking stop' and 'start' again, connection works for ~30 seconds until the 169.x ip route and address are added to ens3 interface

2021-11-25 11:46:33	jelly	link-local setup isn't supposed to create a default route, I think

2021-11-25 11:47:49	ocb	tried already, the command doesnt delete the route
