2021-11-25 11:44:42	pardis	there's no live image with X, but you can install OpenBSD to a USB stick
2021-11-25 11:44:47	IcePic	one can install to a usb stick and boot from that
2021-11-25 11:44:56	pardis	Wayland is a WIP, so currently sway will not work
2021-11-25 11:45:33	pardis	but you can use i3
2021-11-25 11:49:02	LXGHTNXNG	similar such user in #freebsd
2021-11-25 11:52:19	Velkorq	pardis: oh but it seems to work in freebsd, i thought the packages are common between the two
2021-11-25 11:53:04	pardis	that seems like a fairly terrible assumption to make
2021-11-25 11:53:32	Velkorq	doesn't it port over packages from freebsd ports?
2021-11-25 11:53:43	pardis	no
2021-11-25 11:53:52	Velkorq	thats what i thought. also will not the usb installation be slow?
2021-11-25 11:53:57	LXGHTNXNG	the projects split in the 90s
2021-11-25 11:54:03	Velkorq	it was super slow when i tried it for linux distros
2021-11-25 11:54:23	pardis	if you use a slow USB device, you'll have slow I/O, but that would be true for a live image as well
2021-11-25 11:54:35	Velkorq	wanted to try out the system but dont want to partition my drive or change grub etc
2021-11-25 11:55:00	pardis	you can just run it in a VM
2021-11-25 11:55:01	Velkorq	can i just get an external hdd/ssd that connects with usb3.0 and install there? won't this be as fast as the internal ssd?
2021-11-25 11:55:15	LXGHTNXNG	it won't
2021-11-25 11:55:17	Velkorq	i wanted a bare metal install
2021-11-25 11:55:18	LXGHTNXNG	but it'll be okay
2021-11-25 11:55:30	LXGHTNXNG	also you could plug a blank ssd internally if on a workstation
2021-11-25 11:55:49	Velkorq	its a laptop, switching drives requires me to unscrew the entire bottom part
2021-11-25 11:56:14	LXGHTNXNG	super sigh
2021-11-25 11:56:29	LXGHTNXNG	back in my day... *sounds like an old grandpa*
2021-11-25 11:56:56	Velkorq	yes they changed them the last couple of years. my old laptops had a small door to get access to the hdd
2021-11-25 11:56:58	Velkorq	or the ram
2021-11-25 11:57:18	Velkorq	they seem to follow mac logic now, to make it as hard as possible

2021-11-25 12:37:10	renaud	this kind of thing can happen on -current
2021-11-25 12:37:24	Han	ldd /usr/local/lib/libisc-9.16.23.so  and then look for which library that library is missing.
2021-11-25 12:38:10	Voyager_MP	Yes I'm, there is no lib missing

2021-11-25 12:38:42	Voyager_MP	isc-bind is broken, isc-bind-9.16.23v3 and isc-bind-9.16.23v3-geoip
2021-11-25 12:39:19	Lucas6023	> host is failing
2021-11-25 12:39:23	Voyager_MP	removeing the package solved the host problem, since I dont use bind anymore, there is no need anyway
2021-11-25 12:39:31	Lucas6023	host as in /usr/bin/host ? it shouldn't be using a lib from ports
2021-11-25 12:39:41	pardis	no, isc-bind provides its own implementation of host

2021-11-25 12:39:56	pardis	so this can happen if you override the default $PATH for some silly reason
2021-11-25 12:40:08	pardis	(OpenBSD's default $PATH will put /usr/bin before /usr/local/bin)
2021-11-25 12:40:24	Voyager_MP	exactly
2021-11-25 12:40:30	Lucas6023	mhm, that's what I wanted to get to
2021-11-25 12:41:01	Voyager_MP	I see that now too :D, gooing to cahnge my default path right away :D
